            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Black Bean Soup</h1><p>by Ree on April 14, 2014 I have several things to say about this recipe I'm sharing today. First: It has nothing to do with Easter. But I'll make that up to you. Second: Oh, was it good. Third: Beans are my life. Don't tell anyone.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/aa31adf3c5846cd932a04623af70774dd35fe9b1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cinnamon White Russian - Pinch of Yum</h1><p>This post was created in partnership with Absolut. Enjoy responsibly! Tis the season for creamy-sweet Cinnamon White Russians! ðŸŽ„ Preferably shared with friends, at a Christmas party, around a tree and a collection of white elephant gifts that will make you laugh until you cry. Or at least that's how we do it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/183742a0f7b464efddd472126aadbcc7533d3761.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>fried egg sandwich with bacon and blue cheese</h1><p>Due to a delightful clerical error (a scheduled babysitter when we forgot Alex would be home from work), I got to have a weekday lunch with my husband on President's Day. In a restaurant. With linens on the table and no sippy cups in a two-table radius!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f37eab740acd35a80aa500031cef023f49618f21.jpg"></article>]]></description>
