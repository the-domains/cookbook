            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>No-Bake Peanut Butter Chocolate Cream Pie - Crazy for Crust</h1><p>I really have no words for this pie. It's a jaw-dropping pie with layers of Oreo crust, peanut butter, and chocolate cream. I just can't even express how good it was. Words like decadent, amazing, creamy, and delicious just don't seem to suffice. Because it was better than all of those words.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b0916e17f75a69ee42c16984a7374b02b3b7e8a0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

There's a sink, a single induction burner, a huge silver champagne bucket (that floods brilliantly with water and ice-packs for "refrigeration"), a stack of cutting boards, and as you can imagine, no shortage of knives.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/894ada9e3ecd858ac5249d59cf5e382014b79e4b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Black Bean Soup</h1><p>by Ree on April 14, 2014 I have several things to say about this recipe I'm sharing today.
