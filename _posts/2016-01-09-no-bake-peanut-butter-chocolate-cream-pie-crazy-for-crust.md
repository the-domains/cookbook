description: "I really have no words for this pie. It's a jaw-dropping pie with layers of Oreo crust, peanut butter, and chocolate cream. I just can't even express how good it was. Words like decadent, amazing, creamy, and delicious just don't seem to suffice. Because it was better than all of those words."
